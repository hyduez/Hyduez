### 🎯 About me

> I started creating Discord Bots with a NodeJS library, this allowed me to understand some JavaScript characters and speed up my learning in other languages 🍀 

>My knowledge is quite limited in programming, so I plan to spend more time on this because it is something that I like and it impresses me with the things that can be created with dedication 👨‍💻
